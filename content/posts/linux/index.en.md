Let's face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.

**Markdown** is a better way to write **HTML**, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.

Some of the key benefits are:

1. Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it's also quicker to write content.
2. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown.
3. Produces valid XHTML output.
4. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site.
5. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like.
6. Markdown is a joy to use!
